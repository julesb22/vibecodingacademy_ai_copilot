**ðŸš€ Major Emily Update: Enhanced Tools & Better Performance**
Hey @channel!
I just rolled out a significant upgrade to Vibe Coding Academyâ€™s Emily (Vibe Coding Academyâ€™s MCP server) that addresses the token limitations Claude Code users were experiencing and significantly improves how Emily interprets and responds to your vibe coding challenges
Whatâ€™s New:
- Expanded Tool Access: Iâ€™ve resolved the Cloud Code limitations that were restricting tool availability
- Smarter Task Understanding: Emily now better comprehends your specific requests for more accurate results
- Enhanced Tool Suite: The toolkitâ€™s been refined from 8 tools into 25-30 specialized tools for more precise assistance
Updated Resources:
App documentation has been refreshed with the latest Emily capabilities
