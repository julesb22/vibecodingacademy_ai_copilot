Hi @channel 👋

Happy to announce a new feature on Vibe Coding Academy: it is now possible to track your progress throughout the Master Course 📈

Once you have finished visualizing a video tutorial, you can mark the video tutorial as “Completed” ✅

You can also decide to mark an entire session as “Completed”, which will automatically flag the tutorials within that session as “Completed” :white_tick::white_tick::white_tick:

You can visualize your progress within the “Master Course Progress” section inside the “Course” page, as well as inside the “Master Course Overview” section in the dashboard page

N.B: By default, all your session and tutorials are set to “Not Completed :x:” since your were not able to track your progress before, but you can choose to complete the entire session if you want to go faster completing your progress!

Hope you’ll like it, and as usual, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

Cheers!
