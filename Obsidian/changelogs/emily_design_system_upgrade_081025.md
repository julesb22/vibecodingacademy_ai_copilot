**ðŸŽ¨ Emily Design System Upgrade: Import Existing Designs & Access 21st.dev Components**

Hey @channel!

Emily just got a major design workflow upgrade that's going to transform how you build prototypes in Lovable, V-zero, Bolt, and other tools. Two powerful new capabilities landed today:

**What's New:**

**1. Import Existing Design Systems ðŸ“¥**
- Emily now asks if you want to use an existing design system instead of starting from scratch
- Simply import your design tokens in JSON format and Emily will mimic your established designs
- Perfect for maintaining brand consistency across prototypes or reusing proven design systems

**2. Enhanced Custom Design Systems with 21st.dev Integration âœ¨**
- Massively improved the custom design system creation flow
- Emily can now suggest and integrate components from 21st.dev's library
- Two flexible workflows:
  - Customize components directly on 21st.dev, then import them into your PRD
  - Ask Emily to leverage pre-built 21st.dev components for you
- Access to unusual, animated components with advanced effects like glassmorphism
- Result: More polished, professional prototypes with less effort

As always, reach out if you have questions or feedback ðŸš€

Cheers!
