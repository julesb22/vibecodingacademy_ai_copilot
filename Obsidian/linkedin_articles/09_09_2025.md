# Vibe Coding Academy isn't just another learning platform for vibe coding: it's your sandbox for becoming the PM of tomorrow.

Product Management today moves at the speed of AI.  

New tools, new frameworks, new expectations. Every single week.

👉 You want that promotion you’ve been eyeing.  
👉 You want to apply for this dream job with confidence.  
👉 You want the option to go the freelance path and actually land gigs.  

In all cases, one thing is non-negotiable: **you need to keep leveling up your skills.**

And here’s the truth I’ve learned: the best way for PMs to learn is **by building themselves.**

When you build a feature or side project yourself, you’re mimicking exactly what happens in a product trio: you prioritize, you make bets, you ship, you measure, you adjust...

The problem? Until recently, it was hard to build without being a dev.  
No-code and low-code tools gave some flexibility, but they came with steep learning curves and frustrating limits.

Now, you can **vibe code**: describe what you want in natural language and build production-grade apps you fully control.

- Want to sharpen your dev-collab skills? Build a real side project.  
- Want to become a stronger AI PM? Build a small AI wrapper and write AI evals to improve its output.  
- Preparing for a Growth PM role? Build and optimize onboarding in your own app.  
- Targeting a job at a company like Mistral AI or OpenAI? Build something using their API.  

This is the vision behind **Vibe Coding Academy**: a sandbox where PMs can build, learn, and stay ahead of the curve.
