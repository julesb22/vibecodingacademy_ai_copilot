I think we're going to see a new type of business model emerging: expertise-as-a-service, powered by MCP.


Here's what I mean: selling access to custom MCPs that package years of specialized knowledge. 

  

Your expertise becomes your product, and MCP is the distribution channel.

  

Think about it: You've spent 15 years developing your own expertise. 

  

Somethings that LLMs simply can't replicate.

  

This expertise is valuable. 

  

But right now, it's locked in your head. 

  

Or at best inside outdated prompt libraries: I do see experts building libraries of ready-to-use prompts. 

  

Copy, paste, edit, repeat.

  

It works, but it's clunky. And it doesn't scale.

  

Here's a better way: abstract your expertise into a MCP

  

Model Context Protocol lets you encode your expertise once, then interact with it naturally through any LLM. No more copy-pasting prompts before every task.

  

And here's the best part: even if you never sell access to it, you've built a system that puts your expertise at your fingertips across any AI coding tool, multiplying your productivity by 10x.

  

Here are a few examples of how I see this playing out:

  

Product Designers: If you've built a specific UX/UI framework with rules based on years of expertise, encode it into a custom MCP. Now every design decision automatically considers your proven principles.

  

Product Builders: Years of building taught you a specific stack and methodology. Instead of prompting the LLM at each step, abstract your expertise into an MCP that guides every technical decision.

  

The Three-Step Process using N8N

  

1. Create a template for how you want the LLM to handle your instructions. This pattern becomes your foundation as you add more expertise.

  

2. Use any LLM to transform your specific expertise into that template format. Store this in a private GitHub repo. Build your MCP server (easiest via Next.js) that connects to this repo. Set it up in your AI tool of choice.

  

3. Carve out time to improve your MCP as you discover gaps while using it. Your expertise evolves, your MCP evolves with it.

  

Here's where it gets interesting: Once your expertise lives in an MCP that you continuously refine, you can sell access to it.

  

Imagine paying for direct access to a senior product designer's decision-making framework. Or a growth PM's proven methodology for optimizing activation flows. Or a technical architect's stack-specific best practices.

  

The MCP doesn't just deliver static knowledge. It improves over time as the expert refines it based on new projects and learnings.

  

Are you already packaging your expertise this way? Or do you see this as a business opportunity worth exploring? Drop your thoughts below.
