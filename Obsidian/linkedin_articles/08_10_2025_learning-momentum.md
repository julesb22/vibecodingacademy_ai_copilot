The most challenging part of offering in-depth courses in e-learning? Keeping students moving forward without getting discouraged.

I truly believe momentum is what separates students who finish from those who don't. It's the habit trigger that keeps you learning when others lose courage.

Here are three ways I create momentum for Vibe Coding Academy students:

1. Making concepts as practical as possible with Emily Agent

Most of my video tutorials are screencasts where I vibe code a real project and show each step. Plus, Emily Agent (accessible via Vibe Coding Academy's MCP server) lets you apply each step directly in VS Code, Claude Code, or Cursor on your own project. Students who opt for the Course + Emily Agent bundle can follow video tutorials while building their actual products. No theory-only learning. 

2. Showing progress inside the app

You can now track your progress on tutorials and sessions directly in the platform. I'm far from a Duolingo-like experience, but that's the path I'm going for. The goal? Create that satisfaction of visible progress that keeps you coming back.

3. Providing instant Slack community access

Every course purchase includes immediate access to our Slack community. Two key benefits: First, ask questions about the course directly. I answer them myself so you never stay stuck. Second, promote your projects and get feedback from other vibe coders who understand the builder journey.

The goal with all three? Don't let students feel alone. Keep them applying concepts. Show them they're making progress.

What's your take? Do you see other features or improvements that could create even more momentum for learners?
