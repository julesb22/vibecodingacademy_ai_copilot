# When I look back 12 months in time, it feels like I'm visiting the Stone Age.

It's incredible how AI has created such a staggering productivity gap between "then" and "now."  

If you managed to carve out time to master these tools, you know exactly what I mean.  

## THEN vs NOW:

- **Meeting notes?**  
  Then: I used to write up meeting notes manually during and after meetings  
  Now: I'm never writing meeting notes again thanks to Granola that auto-transcribes, summarizes via templates, and enables chat interactions  

- **Prototypes?**  
  Then: I used to spend hours in Figma  
  Now: I use Lovable to generate mockups + frontend code that syncs directly to Cursor  

- **Presentations?**  
  Then: I used to battle with Google Slides  
  Now: I use Gamma that handles almost all the design while I focus on the content itself  

- **Writing?**  
  Then: I used to spend 80% of my time on grammar fixes  
  Now: I can dedicate most of my time to creating new content ideas and thinking about how to convey them, while outsourcing the polish to GPT-4/Claude  

- **Websites?**  
  Then: I used to rely on Framer for my website and blog  
  Now: my website is fully vibe-coded on Next.js using a combination of v0 by Vercel and Cursor. I own 100% of the code, making the website both faster to ship and better looking. I also own the backend, using Notion as a headless CMS via its free API  

- **Automation?**  
  Then: I used to hand-code scripts inside Zapier and n8n  
  Now: I'm delegating everything to ChatGPT 4.0 or Claude Sonnet 4.0  

- **PRDs?**  
  Then: I used to write them up including user stories and acceptance criteria myself  
  Now: I completely outsource the heavy lifting to Vibe Coding Academy's Emily Agent (via MCP)  

- **YouTube Thumbnails and LinkedIn post images?**  
  Then: I used to create most of them manually in Figma  
  Now: I often outsource the image generation to ChatGPT 4.0 or Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana)  

- **Building a Backend?**  
  Then: I used to rely on low-code tools like BuildShip or Xano  
  Now: I fully vibe code flexible backends with a combination of Cursor, Claude Code and Warp  

- **Building a Startup?**  
  Then: I thought I had to wait for a CTO to join me  
  Now: I'm building production-ready apps solo

The shift isn't about automating tasks to work 4 hours a week â†’ it's about outsourcing tasks to focus your energy on creativity and ideas.  

ðŸ’¡ What about you? Did you encounter the same type of transformation?  
And if yes, I'm curious to know what changed in your productivity stack ðŸ¤“
