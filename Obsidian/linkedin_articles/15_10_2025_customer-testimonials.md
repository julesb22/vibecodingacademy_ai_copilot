Revenue feels good. Customer testimonials feel better.

Seeing someone ship their own SaaS, build full-stack apps that attract co-founders, or gain the technical credibility to mentor other builders. That's the real fulfillment.

Here's are Three Vibe Coding Academy students showing what's possible:

Dimitri - Customer team, zero tech background. The course broke his fear of IDE, terminal, and Git. Now fully autonomous building full-stack apps with Lovable and Cursor. Shipped his own SaaS: https://getproof.ai/

Shadab - PM at Optimizely. Couldn't find another course at this price covering app building AND technical concepts like APIs, databases, and auth. Now working on side projects and mentoring at a major Bangladesh incubator [NSU Startups Next](https://www.linkedin.com/company/north-south-university-startups-next/)

Giuseppe - PM stuck giving design feedback. Built a full-stack app with dozens of API connections, got users, impressed a senior dev. They're now co-founding together: https://trendible.framer.ai/

This is why Vibe Coding Academy's Master Course exists. To equip PMs with skills to become AI coders. Whether you're working for a company or building your own, you'll need to be a Product Builder.

Companies are asking more from PMs. The skills gap between what's needed and what's available is growing.

Fill that gap. Get the opportunities.
