15 Minutes a Day Keeps the AI FOMO Away

Feeling overwhelmed by the constant stream of new AI models, tools, and techniques? You're not alone.

Everyone's scared by the pace at which AI is evolving. 

We think we need to spend hours daily just to keep up. And honestly? That belief is justified: the pace IS overwhelming.

But here's the reality: Nobody can keep up with everything.

So instead of trying to drink from the fire hose, I've implemented a simple habit that works:

15 minutes every morning before I start my workday, I watch one AI-related video or read one article.

That's it. No marathon learning sessions. No guilt about missing the latest breakthrough.

Why this works?
• Timing matters: Before work starts, I'm focused. Once the day begins, I get bogged down and never find time to learn. This works for me, maybe another time better fits your schedule.
• Consistency beats quantity: Small daily investments compound over time
• Zero overwhelm: 15 minutes feels manageable, not daunting

Here are 3 pieces of advices on this:

**1. Optimize for output vs. investment**
- Skip books (too time-intensive for rapidly changing field)
- Choose newsletters and videos that deliver actionable insights
- Watch at 1.25x minimum speed when possible

**2. Learn what you can apply immediately**
- Need to improve AI evals at your company? Watch content specifically about AI evaluation processes
- Working on prompt engineering? Focus on tactical prompt optimization techniques
- The best way to retain knowledge is to use right away

**3. Curate your sources carefully**
- Follow 4-5 high-quality creators who consistently deliver value
- Here's a list you should pick from for everything related to vibe coding:

Again don't feel overwhelmed by what you don't know, focus on building a sustainable learning habit around topics you can directly apply.

The goal isn't to know everything—it's to stay consistently informed about what matters most to your work.
