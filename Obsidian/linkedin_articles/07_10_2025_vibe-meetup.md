The worst part of running an e-learning platform? You never get to meet your community face-to-face.

That's one of the reason why I jumped at the chance when Victor and Pierre from Strapi invited me to speak at the first Vibe Coding Community meetup in Paris.

I shared my vision for how product teams will evolve in the next 2-3 years, and how vibe coding gives PMs an unfair advantage in that new landscape.

During the event, the energy was electric, and the speakers delivered. 

Here are my top takeaways from the other speakers:

Niels Rolland and the Paatch team built a 2,000+ community of freelancers and builders organizing events with V0, Lovable, Make, and other tools. I think they have one or two good contacts in their CRM ðŸ˜‚

Claire Champourlier showed how to apply graph databases and Neo4J principles for a high social impact project using N8N. 

Augustin from Hello Dev articulated something I deeply believe: "Let's build a vibe coding tool on existing architectures." Internal teams already already have up and running processes on N8N, Notion, or their existing ERPs. Why not build vibe coding tools on top of what's already there? Smart strategy. Exciting vision. Can't wait to see where this French vibe coding tool goes next.

Pierre Burgy dropped some serious hints about Strapi's upcoming release. For context: Strapi is an open-source headless CMS with almost 70K GitHub stars. If you're currently choosing between Contentful or Framer, you might want to wait a few weeks before making that decision.

Thanks again to Strapi for the opportunity, and can't wait for the other Vibe Coding event to come!
