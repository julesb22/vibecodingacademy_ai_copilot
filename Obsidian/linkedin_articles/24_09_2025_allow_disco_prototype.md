Prototyping is easier than ever. And more pointless than ever.

Here's the paradox driving product teams crazy:

You can whip up a prototype in Framer or Bolt in minutes. Looks gorgeous. Functions perfectly.

Then reality hits.

Your beautiful prototype has ZERO connection to your actual product. Different design system. Different components. Different everything.

It's like building a Ferrari prototype when you need to upgrade a Honda.

## The $10K Problem Nobody Talks About

Every disconnected prototype costs teams serious money:
- Designer hours rebuilding components that already exist
- Developer time translating fantasy into reality
- Stakeholder confusion when "the prototype worked fine"
- Endless back-and-forth explaining why it can't look exactly like the mockup

Sound familiar?

## Three Solutions That Actually Work

**Option 1: Teach Your Team Git**
Onboard product folks on Claude Code, Git branches, and deployment tools like ngrok.
Yes, it's technical. But teams that master this workflow prototype 3x faster.
They build on actual codebases. With real components. In real environments.

**Option 2: Figma Make + Design System**
If your design system is properly set up in Figma, use Figma Make to generate prototypes.
Your components are already there. Your tokens are defined. Your spacing is consistent.
It's like having a design system that actually talks to your prototyping tool.

**Option 3: Browser-Based Prototyping**
Tools like Alloy let you prototype directly on your existing product.
No code knowledge required. No design system disconnect.
I recently tested Alloy and was genuinely impressed - you can build meaningful prototypes in minutes, not days.

## The Real Game Changer

When your prototype uses your actual design system, magic happens:
‚úì Stakeholders see realistic expectations
‚úì Developers estimate accurately
‚úì Design-to-development handoff becomes seamless
‚úì Teams ship features 40% faster

Stop building prototypes that lie about what's possible.
Start prototyping what you can actually build.
