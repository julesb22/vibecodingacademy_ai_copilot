Everyone's talking about Anthropic, OpenAI, Lovable, and Cursor these days.

But there's one company we're sleeping on: Vercel (and they just raised 300M $)

Here's the thing: Vercel built Next.js, which is arguably the most intuitive full-stack framework out there. 

But they've quietly assembled an entire ecosystem that makes building AI wrappers ridiculously fast.

If I were launching an AI wrapper tomorrow, here's my exact playbook using Vercel's stack:

Step 1: Design with V0
V0 generates clean, production-ready frontend code. But here's the kicker: since Vercel built both V0 and Next.js, your design automatically comes with proper Next.js structure. No messy refactoring required when you build the backend.

Step 2: Sync to Your IDE
V0's native GitHub integration lets you push code directly to Cursor or your IDE of choice. Now you're building backend features (like Supabase connections) on top of solid foundations.

Step 3: Implement AI with Vercel AI SDK
This is where it gets interesting. The AI SDK includes:
- AI Elements: Pre-built frontend components specifically for AI features
- AI Gateway: The real game-changer

AI Gateway = One API key for every major LLM
No juggling multiple integrations. You want implement an AI workflows that requires orchestrating several models ? Use one key. Done.

It also connect with image generation models like Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (most widely know as Nano Banana)

Plus you get:
- Built-in observability to monitor usage and costs
- Side-by-side playground to compare model outputs before committing

Step 4: Add Authentication
Auth.js integrates seamlessly. You could use Supabase Auth, but Auth.js keeps everything in the Vercel ecosystem if that's your preference.

Step 5: Deploy and Ship
Once your backend logic is ready, configure Vercel to automatically deploy whenever you merge a pull request. No manual deployments needed: just merge your pull request and it's live. You can even register your domain directly through Vercel Domains. Everything in one place.


I'm probably forgetting half the features, but this workflow cuts weeks off typical development cycles.
