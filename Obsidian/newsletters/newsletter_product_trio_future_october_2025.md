### **I spoke at Europe's most famous SaaS incubator ðŸŽ¤**

---

I recently had the honor of speaking at Hexa, Europe's most renowned SaaS incubator, where I shared my vision on the future of product management and how AI is fundamentally reshaping the PM landscape. The talk centered on the emergence of new hybrid roles like product engineers and AI-augmented PMs that are redefining what it means to build products in 2025. The presentation sparked fascinating conversations about how traditional PM boundaries are dissolving. We're witnessing PMs who can prototype their own ideas, validate concepts in hours instead of weeks, and leverage AI to handle technical execution while maintaining strategic focus. The full presentation is available at [vibecodingacademy.ai/hexa-vibe-coding-meetup](https://www.vibecodingacademy.ai/hexa-vibe-coding-meetup), and you can check out highlights on my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jules-boiteux_main-flipside-of-running-an-e-learning-platform-activity-7381580371001499649-u0v7).

## The Future of the Product Trio: Less Craft, More Babysitting

Remember when being a great engineer meant writing beautiful code? When designers spent days perfecting Figma mockups? When PMs prided themselves on comprehensive PRDs?

That world is ending. Not because these skills don't matter, but because AI is reshaping what "doing the work" actually means.

The truth: traditional craft skills are being automated away. What's replacing them? Something less glamorous but more valuable: **becoming a Product Builder who babysits AI.**

Let's break down what's happening to the three core roles, and what you need to do about it.

### Engineers: From Code Craftsmen to Product Engineers

**The Old Craft:** Engineers translated specs into working code. They thought architecturally, wrote modular systems, and took pride in clean codebases. The craft was in the *how*.

**The AI Disruption:** AI codes better and faster than most developers. Tools like Claude and Cursor don't just autocomplete, they architect entire features, write tests, and catch bugs you'd miss. Engineers using AI are seeing a massive surge in their output. The problem? Companies don't need 10x more features. Instead, they're asking engineers to move up the value chain and handle specs, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

**The New Reality:** Modern engineers spend **80% iterating over specs and 20% babysitting AI**. That babysitting is critical: verifying code structure, running QA at checkpoints, ensuring AI didn't introduce vulnerabilities.

Engineers are evolving into **Product Engineers** who own the entire feature lifecycle. You're defining what to build, validating it, and shipping end-to-end. Winning companies hire Product Engineers who go from problem to solution without three meetings.

### Designers: From Pixel Pushers to Discovery Specialists

**The Old Craft:** Designers turned customer problems into beautiful interfaces. They lived in Figma, crafting flows that balanced user needs with business goals.

**The AI Disruption:** Tools like Lovable, Figma Make and Bolt turn text prompts into functional frontends in minutes. No more painstaking component design. AI generates working prototypes that look professional.

**The New Reality:** Designers are shifting from execution to **discovery and verification**. The valuable work happens in two places:

First, **upfront discovery**: conversations with customers, hunting inspiration, understanding unmet needs that require human intuition.

Second, **AI oversight**: The output is still the same: pixel-perfect prototypes and screens. But the path has changed. Instead of manually crafting components in Figma, you're prompting tools like Figma Make with functional specs and wireframes. Your value comes from feeding AI with context, intuition, and design direction, then verifying outputs align with your framework. You're quality control ensuring AI-generated prototypes solve user problems elegantly.

The designers who thrive won't push pixels fastest. They'll spot opportunities AI misses and ensure AI-generated designs deliver great experiences.

### Product Managers: Choose Your Own Adventure

**The Old Craft:** PMs wrote PRDs, defined problems, drafted specs, and created releases. The best PMs had encyclopedic market knowledge and synthesized complex requirements into clear direction.

**The AI Disruption:** AI now drafts PRDs and fetches more competitive data than seasoned PMs can gather. It analyzes feedback at scale, identifies patterns, and suggests feature priorities.

**The New Reality:** PMs face a fork in the road with three viable paths:

**Path 1: Product Engineer** - Ramp up technically and own features from concept to code. Validate ideas by building, not writing documents.

**Path 2: Strategic PM** - Go upstream. Translate market signals into roadmap strategy. Connect dots AI can't: competitor moves, emerging needs, business alignment. Master pricing strategy, product positioning, and partnerships, finding integrations that expand distribution.

**Path 3: AI PM/Product Engineer** - Specialize in AI-powered features. Understand implications and constraints of building with LLMs and vector databases.

The PMs who'll struggle? Those clinging to traditional work: writing specs AI writes better, compiling data AI aggregates faster, managing processes AI automates.

### The Bigger Picture: Everyone Becomes a Product Builder

Role boundaries are blurring. Engineers do more product thinking. Designers do more strategy. PMs do more building. We're all becoming **Product Builders**: shipping value, not protecting territories.

What distinguishes great Product Builders from AI?

1. **Intuition** - Sensing which problems matter before data proves it
2. **Creativity** - Imagining solutions AI wouldn't generate
3. **Gut feeling** - Making judgment calls when answers aren't obvious
4. **Marketing instinct** - Understanding how to position and sell what you build

The market rewards this. Generalist Product Builders command higher salaries and enable companies to ship faster with smaller teams.

**The uncomfortable truth:** babysitting AI sounds less prestigious than being a "craftsperson." But craftspeople optimize for elegance. Builders optimize for impact.

In the AI era, impact wins. Are you still perfecting your craft, or learning to build?
