Hi there, 

Some of you might be in full vacation mode üá™üá∫‚õ±Ô∏è, others still powering through work like August doesn‚Äôt exist. 

Either way, here‚Äôs your latest newsletter.

This time we‚Äôll start with the quick updates on what‚Äôs new at **Vibe Coding Academy** over the past two weeks.

Then, I dig into the exclusive content around the question that keeps coming up:

**Should I stick vibe coding with Lovable, or is it time to explore Cursor and Claude Code?**

And as always, I‚Äôve included a short digest of recent LinkedIn posts you may have missed.

Let‚Äôs dive in üëá

## Vibe Coding Academy‚Äôs news

---

### Meet Emily (in beta) üéâ

---

**Emily is officially available in beta**

This is your AI agent, who will guide you step-by-step through building a production-ready app using the Vibe Coding Academy method.

She runs on an MCP server, so you can call her directly from Claude or Cursor. It‚Äôs the fastest way to learn how to build an app by doing, and apply it instantly to your own project.

üé• [Here‚Äôs a short demo video](https://www.notion.so/Newsletter-August-8th-248ecaf7ca50803ea470d7d09b4a6be9?pvs=21)

Emily is free for all current Master Course customers and anyone who purchases the course before the end of August.

After that, new pricing will launch with standalone and bundle options for Emily and the course.

Still want to wait for the launch but want early access with a launch discount?

Join the waitlist here üëâ https://www.vibecodingacademy.ai/mcp, I‚Äôll send details a week before the official rollout in early September.

### The hackathon happens this Saturday

---

As I mentioned in the last version of the newsletter, Vibe Coding Academy is sponsoring the PM Live Vibe Coding Challenge hosted by [**Aakanksha Sharma**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAzOIzoBMZB2UCuiSCvKP2I2hWBzYWKWYPM) (Group PM @ Microsoft UK) and [**Hitesh Dua**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAs78p8BVCslfZ4ITiJL6UEv-FH7FCMkFyU) (Director of Technology at [**VetFamily**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vetfamily/))

t‚Äôs happening this **Saturday from 3 to 5 p.m. CEST**.

We‚Äôve already hit 120% of the attendee cap, but we‚Äôre opening a few more spots for last-minute sign-ups.

Fun challenge + cool prizes up for grabs üéÅ

### Referral program is out soon

---

I‚Äôm putting the final touches on an official referral program for Vibe Coding Academy‚Äôs Master Course.

You‚Äôll soon be able to refer friends, give them a discount, and earn a solid refund on your own purchase in return.

More details coming soon!

## Should you stick with Lovable or should you learn Cursor?

---

The Master Course teaches you how to build a production-ready app by combining tools like Lovable and Cursor.

One common (and fair) question I get about Vibe Coding Academy is: *Why use Cursor at all? Why not just stick with Lovable?*

While I won‚Äôt go into all the technical differences here, I want to share a simple framework that should help clarify when and why Cursor becomes essential.

You may still have questions afterward, but this should point you in the right direction.

### What are the two main factors to take into account?

---

This depends on the **ultimate goal** of the application and the **depth of features** you aim to include.

Taking this into account, I break it down into three categories:

- **Prototype**
    
    This is the equivalent of a Figma prototype ‚Äî a quick first iteration, built without any backend logic. Whether you're exploring a new side project or scoping a feature for your company, the goal here is to validate that you're heading in the right direction. Speed and iteration matter more than functionality.
    
- **MVP**
    
    My definition of an MVP is a product with the minimum set of features required to verify your value proposition. In most cases, that means validating that people are willing to pay for it. As such, it should include essential backend functionality like user authentication and payments.
    
    However, it doesn't need to be perfectly structured. The goal is not to build something scalable yet ‚Äî it‚Äôs to validate demand. Once that‚Äôs done, you can raise funds and bring on a CTO to rebuild the app cleanly for long-term growth.
    
- **Production-Ready App**
    
    This is a more mature application ‚Äî one that not only validates your value proposition with a working paywall but is also built with enough structure to be maintained and improved without needing a CTO. You feel confident fixing bugs and shipping new features. The app includes a proper setup (e.g., staging and production environments) to ensure safe development practices. If needed, it‚Äôs also in a state where a CTO could easily take over and scale it further.

### **Your technical level**

Your technical level depends on two things:

1. Whether you've had the opportunity to roll up your sleeves and write code
2. Whether you‚Äôve worked closely with technical teams in the past

Based on that, here‚Äôs the breakdown:

- **Non-Technical**
    
    You‚Äôve never written code and never worked closely with technical teams. This could be a product designer who relied on a product manager to interface with developers, or someone coming from marketing or sales with no exposure to the product delivery process.
    
- **Tech-Aware**
    
    You haven‚Äôt coded, but you‚Äôve collaborated with engineers before. You understand the basic structure of an application ‚Äî what a frontend is, a backend, an API endpoint, etc. This is often the case for junior product managers or more senior product designers who worked in teams without a dedicated PM to bridge with engineering. 
    
- **Fairly Technical**
    
    You‚Äôve already experimented with code, even if you‚Äôve never worked as a developer per se. You‚Äôre comfortable with more advanced technical concepts like webhooks, know SQL, and use tools like Postman with ease. Typically, you‚Äôre a product manager with an engineering background, or you've worked on highly technical products that required deeper technical involvement. This also applies to growth hackers and similar roles, where coding scripts or setting up automations is part of the job.
    
- **Engineer**
    
    You have several years of coding experience and can independently ship features. Vibe coding and AI tools are force multipliers for your productivity.
    

### The Framework

Here‚Äôs a simple matrix to help you identify which setup best fits your needs:

### Conclusion

---

- If you want to build a simple **mocked prototype** with no backend or very limited functionality, use **Lovable**.
- If you're aiming for an **MVP** with backend features (like auth or payments) that you‚Äôre willing to throw away after validating your assumptions ‚Äî and you‚Äôve **never written code before** ‚Äî choose **Lovable** or **Replit**. Both let you build real backends, but without full control.
- If you're ready to build a **production-ready app** that you can **maintain and evolve on your own**, go for a combination of **Lovable + Cursor**.
    - If you're not quite technical yet, **Replit** can serve as a stepping stone ‚Äî helping you gain confidence before switching to Cursor, which gives you **more autonomy and flexibility** in the long run.
