Besides that, I’m also sharing some exclusive content for you, this time with a reference to Stoicism and *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius. 

And, as usual, an update on what’s been happening at Vibe Coding Academy over the past few weeks.

Hope you enjoy it, and let’s dive in!

## 🧘 5 meditations on vibe coding

---

One of my favorite books is *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius.

![marcuse_aurelius.jpg](attachment:6481a823-40cf-4a80-8009-7712b44a9df1:marcuse_aurelius.jpg)

It’s not a philosophy manual, it’s his personal diary. A set of notes written in times of war, plague, and deep personal loss. Thoughts he leaned on to act with clarity when everything else was chaos.

That’s the essence of Stoicism: thoughts as anchors for action.

Today, I want to share my own *Meditations,* but applied to vibe coding. Five short reflections that guide how I build, learn, and approach product in a world where AI is reshaping the craft.

Take them as nudges. Use them when you need direction.

### 1. Distribution >> Product

---

Building apps is no longer the hard part. With vibe coding, anyone can launch a product without hunting for a CTO. The true bottleneck is distribution.

Your unfair advantage isn’t code, it’s getting your product in front of users.

By unfair advantage in distribution, I mean your ability to get your product in front of thousands of people quickly and at low cost.

Where can you find that edge?

- Create content in your niche (newsletter, YouTube, LinkedIn).
- Leverage your past roles: old networks (and specifically network of customers) can be gold.
- Use an existing customer base on a successful product or service to launch new products.
- Build product-led flywheels thanks that grow on their own.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth for PMs: marketing is now more important than building.

If you can’t see a path to unfair distribution early on, think twice before shipping your app.

### 2. Business Logic >> UX/UI

---

I’m not saying UX/UI is pointless. But I think it’s becoming less of a differentiator.

1. Interfaces are getting standardized. Tools are being used directly inside MCP-compatible environments like Cursor or Claude. Cursor-like AI side-chats are becoming a standardized ways of interacting with a SaaS.
2. Frontend is easier than ever to spin up. But backend business logic? That’s still hard. Connecting external tools, leveraging private data, abstracting our own specific expertise and creativity, that’s where the complexity lies.

This is why the future isn’t SaaS as we know it.

The real value will be in infrastructure: headless systems, verticalized agents, and meta-platforms that sell *logic* too complex to outsource.

Don’t get lost in Lovable tweaks. 

Nail the logic that makes your product irreplaceable.

Think from the get-go how to make your product accessible from LLMs

### 3. Learn yourself >> Learn at your existing company

---

Don’t tell your boss. 😅

Traditionally, PM skills like product sense, prioritization, user research had to be learned inside the company. Because you had to be part of a full-fledged team that includes devs and designers. You needed others to execute your ideas.

Not anymore.
With vibe coding, you can ship on your own and recreate the exact conditions you face at work. It’s a faster, more authentic way to grow.

I’m not saying you don’t get to learn anything at your current job role. I’m just saying there are opportunities to learn fast outside of your daily job, for example by building a side-hustle.

Plus, companies rarely keep pace with the speed of tool innovation. By learning solo, you’ll always be ahead.

Pro tip: 15 minutes a day on a YouTube demo, a newsletter, or a micro-build is enough. Compound that, and you’ll be ahead of the curve.

### 4. PMs Must Master Dev Tools

---

VS Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI: these are no longer “for developers only.”

Pair them with AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini CLI) and you suddenly hold superpowers. Ignore them, and you’re competing blind.

Yes, it feels rough at first. But the payoff is exponential. Just look around:

- Teresa Torres drafts articles in Claude Code (check it out here)
- PMs are shipping features directly in Cursor (check this story of a PM from Doist, who shipped a feature in prod)

So don’t wait. Open a dev tool. Break things. Ship small. The ROI will be career-defining.

(And if you want structured help, you know where to find Vibe Coding Academy’s Master Course 😉).

### 5. PMs Are Best Positioned

---

Here’s my final belief: the next decade belongs to PMs.

Why? Because product sense is hard to automate. It’s the ability to connect business goals with the right features, something AI can assist with, but not replace.

Combine that sense with design, data, and now dev execution through vibe coding, and you become unstoppable.

It’s like starting a marathon five kilometers ahead. 

Others will catch on, but you’ll already be sprinting.

So don’t wait. Lean into vibe coding. 

Build. Learn. Master the tools.

The opportunities waiting for PMs will be unlike anything we’ve seen before.

- Brainstorming
    
    I want to write up an article for my newsletter to share 5 meditations around diacritics. Why do I use them? Why do I call them meditations? It's because I refer to this amazing book that is called "Meditations" from Marcus Aurelius, which is basically a list of personal diary notes that this woman emperor wrote during all the hard times that he had to face, including in wars, plague, personal issues (I think he lost over a dozen of his children). So he wrote those notes to basically define some personal thoughts that he could leverage to nudge him towards action, and that's actually what stoicism is all about: leveraging the power of thought towards action. The idea of this article is to mimic this kind of reasoning with vibe coding, so that any PMs and folks interested in vibe coding can leverage this kind of thought on a regular basis to drive their action on a daily basis.
    
    And so here's the idea: to leverage five main medications that have been regarding questioning that is really, really important.
    
    1. Distribution to the user of the product. I know that there are no technical barriers now to building products, so from the get-go, a product should be designed based on the distribution that is going to enable you to sell the product.
    2. For any products, I think that business logic is going to be even more important than UX/UI. Before you could say that the UX and the UI could be like a different theater, so you could kind of balance some loopholes in your business logic with great user experience. However, now I think that business logic is going to be the most important thing for two reasons:
        1. Because actually UX is getting standardized more and more because people are more expecting to use tools directly from those LLMs (notably through MCP).
        2. Because there are more and more tools which are going to have this AI chat that will enable them to interact basically with the design elements that are really available in the product instead of using classic drag-and-drops and clicks etc.
    
    Another thing that is kind of an unpopular opinion is that I think it's even more important these days to learn by yourself instead of learning at your own company. There are actually two reasons for that:
    
    1. At least for PMs, it used to be really mandatory to learn the job by being part of a comprehensive team that includes developers, designers etc. because to learn products and to learn how to take good decisions from a prioritization standpoint (for instance, being able to measure to what extent the pets that you're focusing your energy on are having an impact on the business), you had to have people out there who could design and ship the features you prioritized. This is not the case anymore. That does not mean that you don't need to learn anything; you are not going to learn at a given company because there are obviously a lot of things that you can still learn. What I'm saying is that it can have an impact on your career to actually carve up maybe more time and energy on learning by yourself.
    2. For me, and obviously that's applies to any job out there, but you know ecosystem is like evolving so rapidly that it's very likely that your company doesn't have the agility to keep up with the pace of new tools coming out etc. which is completely normal. I think no companies out there, even the most agile ones, are able to keep up with that pace.
    
    And the two other important things that I want to mention are:
    
    1. Cash you now learn to master dev tools. Your ideas for instance used to be like only for devs, but you know, there are now tools. Those dev tools are so much more powerful that you cannot put them on the side and overlook those kinds of tools, especially given the fact that they offer MCP capabilities that enable you to connect those tools with suites of other tools that are not necessarily for developers.
    2. If you take the example of Cloud Code, for instance, it enables you to interact with local files (e.g. articles you want to write). We have examples of people writing and refining articles using Cloud Code, and obviously people starting to ship features using Cursor.
    
    This is a strong belief, it's biased, so you take it if you want. But I think for me, product mentors are at least if you are a PM out there, it should release in the upcoming years. Why? Because you have going to be a lot of really amazing opportunities for you if you keep up with at least a minimum set of skills. The main value of a PM is their product sense - how they are going to be able to take their business understanding of their company with the features and products that are developed. These are the kind of skills that require years and years of learning, and if you can combine this with skills like design and data skills that are now partly automated by AI, well, you have a complete set of skills. These product skills are not easily understandable for anyone who has never done some PM job.
