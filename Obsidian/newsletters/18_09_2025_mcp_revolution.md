## Bi-Weekly digest

Here are some news I shared that you may have missed:

**Vibe Coding Academy isn't just another learning platform:** My belief is that the best way to learn product skills isn't through traditional courses, but by building real projects yourself. This is why the guiding mission of Vibe Coding Academy is to help you cross the gap between your idea and your first MVP.

**The AI PM freelance opportunity nobody's talking about:** If I were struggling to land freelance PM work, I'd position myself as an AI evaluation specialist. Companies desperately need PMs who can build the "AI evals flywheel", continuously improving AI models through user feedback, but there's limited supply of this expertise.

**How 15 minutes a day keeps AI FOMO at bay:** Nobody can keep up with everything in AI, and that's okay. The goal isn't to know everything, it's staying consistently informed about what matters to your work. Skip the lengthy books, watch videos at 1.25x speed, and follow 4-5 creators who consistently deliver value.

### **üöÄ Emilie's Agent Launch: A Game-Changer for Product Builders**

---

Emilie's Agent launched successfully!
Thank you to everyone who supported this launch: your feedback, encouragement, and enthusiasm made this possible.

Emilie's Agent guides you through building production-ready applications from concept to deployment. It's basically the same content as the Master Course but accessible via personalized instructions from Emilie, and not through video.

It's now available through Vibe Coding Academy's MCP server. And if you don't know what an MCP is, check out the content section below for more!

### **üìà Progress Tracking Feature: Your Learning Journey, Visualized**

---

You might be wondering what I've been working on behind the scenes, and I'm excited to share that I've just rolled out a feature that many of you have been requesting: comprehensive progress tracking throughout your courses!

This new feature allows you to manually mark tutorials and sessions as complete, giving you a clear visual representation of your journey through each course. I know how important it is to feel that sense of accomplishment as you move forward, there's something incredibly motivating about seeing that progress bar fill up and knowing exactly how far you've come.

The feature is live in production right now, so head over to your dashboard and start tracking your progress. I think you'll find it adds a whole new dimension to your learning experience at Vibe Coding Academy.

### **üéâ Survey Results Are In: Congratulations to Our 5 Winners!**

---

The results from the recent survey are officially out, and I can't thank you enough for the level of engagement and thoughtful feedback I received from the Vibe Coding Academy community. These insights are truly invaluable in helping me shape the future of the platform and the content.

As promised, I'm thrilled to reward Angeline, M√©lanie, Daniel, Nicholas, and Khrystal from the list of survey respondents with two rewards:
- a 30-minute mentorship for free
- free access to Emilie's Agent forever!

If you're one of these lucky winners, keep an eye on your DMs because I'll be reaching out very soon to schedule our session and set up your Emilie's Agent access.

For everyone else, thanks again for helping shape the future of Vibe Coding Academy.

## The MCP Revolution: Why Every PM Needs to Think Like a Platform

**The world just shifted beneath your feet. Did you feel it?**

While you were optimizing conversion funnels and debating button colors, a quiet revolution began reshaping how software works. Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn't just another API standard‚Äîit's the foundation of a new product paradigm that will separate tomorrow's winning PMs from yesterday's feature factories.

### What is MCP?

Think of MCP as the universal translator for AI systems. Just as HTTP enabled websites to talk to each other, MCP enables AI assistants like Cursor, Claude, or other AI tools to securely connect with any data source or tool. It's essentially the HTTP language for basic AI tools.

But here's the kicker: it's not just about data, it's about creating intelligent, interconnected experiences that adapt to user needs in real-time.

**Examples:**

**Tally's MCP:** Tally is a SaaS that enables you to build surveys like Typeform. Instead of manually adding all the questions and possible answers inside Tally's interface, you can now list all the questions you want from Cursor, and the surveys are automatically created. That's a massive productivity gain.

**Vibe Coding Academy's Emily:** Emily enables Vibe Coding Academy's customers to follow the course without having to watch videos inside the platform. They just interact with Vibe Coding Academy's MCP and get personalized answers and step-by-step processes for building applications.

### What does it change for PMs?

**UX Paradigm Shift:** PMs must adapt to a new user experience paradigm. Users now expect to perform actions by providing instructions inside MCP-compatible tools like Claude Code or Cursor, rather than clicking and dragging elements. Users expect to give instructions just like they would to a colleague or intern. This shift isn't entirely new‚ÄîAPI-first SaaS businesses have experienced similar transitions from SaaS to platform thinking, but now it's becoming mainstream.

**Enhanced Context and Productivity:** PMs need to understand that more context will be added to the UX from other tools, improving productivity and accuracy. For instance, if you're Linear, thanks to MCP you can enable users to perform operations directly from Cursor with context coming from other MCPs like Gmail or ProductBoard. The added value of offering an MCP feature is providing more context, thus improving accuracy and productivity.

**Product Marketing and Distribution Changes:** You now position your features as an orchestrator or agent rather than a traditional SaaS. Distribution also shifts from just your website to dedicated platforms like Cursor.directory.

### What can you do now?

**Identify your ecosystem:** Are current users using MCP-compatible tools? Are there distribution channels accessible by these personas?

**Audit your roadmap:** If you have a public API, you may already have some hints about MCP opportunities.

**Come up with a prototype:** N8N offers an MCP node that can be a great way to build a first proof of concept and beta version.

**Bottom line:** In the MCP era, the best product managers in the age of AI don't just build products‚Äîthey orchestrate ecosystems.

Curious to know: Did you already build an MCP for your company? Feel free to reply, would love to know about your story!
