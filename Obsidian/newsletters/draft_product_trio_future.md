# The Future of the Product Trio: Less Craft, More Babysitting

Remember when being a great engineer meant writing beautiful code? When designers spent days perfecting Figma mockups? When PMs prided themselves on comprehensive PRDs?

That world is ending. Not because these skills don't matter—but because AI is reshaping what "doing the work" actually means.

The truth: traditional craft skills are being automated away. What's replacing them? Something less glamorous but more valuable: **becoming a Product Builder who babysits AI.**

Let's break down what's happening to the three core roles—and what you need to do about it.

## Engineers: From Code Craftsmen to Product Engineers

**The Old Craft:** Engineers translated specs into working code. They thought architecturally, wrote modular systems, and took pride in clean codebases. The craft was in the *how*.

**The AI Disruption:** AI codes better and faster than most developers. Tools like Claude and Cursor don't just autocomplete—they architect entire features, write tests, and catch bugs you'd miss.

**The New Reality:** Modern engineers spend **80% iterating over specs and 20% babysitting AI**. That babysitting is critical: verifying code structure, running QA at checkpoints, ensuring AI didn't introduce vulnerabilities.

Engineers are evolving into **Product Engineers** who own the entire feature lifecycle. You're defining what to build, validating it, and shipping end-to-end. Winning companies hire Product Engineers who go from problem to solution without three meetings.

## Designers: From Pixel Pushers to Discovery Specialists

**The Old Craft:** Designers turned customer problems into beautiful interfaces. They lived in Figma, crafting flows that balanced user needs with business goals.

**The AI Disruption:** Tools like Lovable and Bolt turn text prompts into functional frontends in minutes. No more painstaking component design. AI generates working prototypes that are pretty good.

**The New Reality:** Designers are shifting from execution to **discovery and verification**. The valuable work happens in two places:

First, **upfront discovery**: conversations with customers, hunting inspiration, understanding unmet needs that require human intuition. Creativity lives here—not in choosing colors.

Second, **AI oversight**: writing functional specs with wireframes, then prompting AI and verifying outputs align with your framework. You're quality control ensuring AI solves user problems elegantly.

The designers who thrive won't push pixels fastest. They'll spot opportunities AI misses and ensure AI-generated designs deliver great experiences.

## Product Managers: Choose Your Own Adventure

**The Old Craft:** PMs wrote PRDs, defined problems, drafted specs, and created releases. The best PMs had encyclopedic market knowledge and synthesized complex requirements into clear direction.

**The AI Disruption:** AI now drafts PRDs and fetches more competitive data than seasoned PMs can gather. It analyzes feedback at scale, identifies patterns, and suggests feature priorities.

**The New Reality:** PMs face a fork in the road with three viable paths:

**Path 1: Product Engineer** - Ramp up technically and own features from concept to code. Validate ideas by building, not writing documents.

**Path 2: Strategic PM** - Go upstream. Translate market signals into roadmap strategy. Connect dots AI can't: competitor moves, emerging needs, business alignment.

**Path 3: AI PM/Product Engineer** - Specialize in AI-powered features. Understand implications and constraints of building with LLMs and vector databases.

The PMs who'll struggle? Those clinging to traditional work—writing specs AI writes better, compiling data AI aggregates faster, managing processes AI automates.

## The Bigger Picture: Everyone Becomes a Product Builder

These shifts create **blurring boundaries**. Engineers do more product thinking. Designers do more strategy. PMs do more building. Everyone handles more of the value chain.

We're all becoming **Product Builders**—shipping value to customers, not protecting traditional boundaries.

What distinguishes great Product Builders from AI? Four things:

1. **Intuition** - Sensing which problems matter before data proves it
2. **Creativity** - Imagining solutions AI wouldn't generate
3. **Gut feeling** - Making judgment calls when answers aren't obvious
4. **Marketing instinct** - Understanding how to position and sell what you build

The market rewards this. Generalist Product Builders command higher salaries—they enable companies to ship faster with smaller teams. One product engineer replaces three people and ships better results with no communication overhead.

**The uncomfortable truth:** babysitting AI sounds less prestigious than being a "craftsperson." But craftspeople optimize for elegance. Builders optimize for impact.

In the AI era, impact wins. The question isn't whether you'll adapt—it's how fast you'll capture the opportunities.

Are you still perfecting your craft, or learning to build?
